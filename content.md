Always Retrievable: review it


### Your Vision, Always Within Reach
Stop digging through endless chat windows to find that one perfect result. Kloddy transforms your fleeting ideas into a permanent, personal library that grows with you. 

* **Instant Recall**: Your prompts are preserved exactly as you intended, organized into workspaces that make sense for your workflow.
* **Complete Continuity**: Every version is saved, ensuring you can pick up exactly where you left off, months or even years later.
* **Unshakeable Ownership**: You aren't just using AI; you are building a private collection of high-performing assets that belong solely to you.

"Always Within Reach" feels more intimate and helpful than "Always Retrievable."
"Pick up where you left off" highlights the version history feature without using technical jargon.
"Building a legacy/collection" makes the user feel like they are doing something valuable, rather than just "managing data."
